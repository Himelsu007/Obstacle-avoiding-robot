Obstacle avoiding robot #Arduino
This work boils down to a robot that has some features of the original R2D2, however, at a more basic level, the main functionality of this robot is to detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. The original R2D2 has other features such as microphone and speaker, projector, realistic movement, video/photo camera, even sounds and light effects, as we can see, this project only served to deepen knowledge in the C++ language.
